# PROJECTSpubl


The goal of this project is to implement a C program that allows the user to input 20 integers and stores them in a vector. The program will then provide a menu of options for performing various calculations and operations on these values.

The menu will include the following options:

Return the values in multiple-three positions of the vector; Calculation of the sine (sin) of all elements in the vector; Calculation of the division of all elements in the vector by 2; Identify the closest value to 15; Construction of a 20 by 20 matrix, where each row is composed of the vector read (first row) and permutations of its values (other rows); Return the array sorted in descending order.

In addition, a more elaborate version of the project should include the following additional features:

Reading a new vector, calculating and returning the inner product with the initial vector; Calculation of the lowest common multiple of every two consecutive numbers of the vector; Reading a new 1x20 vector, calculating and returning the matrix 20x20 resulting from the product of the initial vector and the new generated vector; Calculation and display of the transposed matrix mentioned in the previous point; The program will include a help page, accessible as entry 7 in the menu; The program will show some help when run from the command line with the --help flag.

This project will require a good understanding of C programming language and matrix operations. The ability to use arrays and loops to store and manipulate the input values will be crucial. The use of built-in math libraries will be necessary to perform trigonometric and mathematical operations. The ability to sort an array and work with multi-dimensional arrays will also be necessary to complete this project.
